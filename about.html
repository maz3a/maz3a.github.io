                    <h3>Me</h3>
                    <p>Hi! My name is Mariam Rabiu. I am a 21 year old from London, UK. I have a Nigerian ethnic background but have grown up in very multi-cultrual environments. I went to school in London until 2021, where I then moved on to university in Stoke-On-Trent. I am currently in my 3rd year of Forensic and Analytical Investigations at Keele University.</p>
                     <h3>Pets</h3>
                <p> I have a pet cat, Nova, who just turned 1, and a 3 year old American Akita called Aryiie. Both of them are a handful and tempermental but also team up with each other to get what they want</p>

                <main>
                    <p>As a neurodiverse individual, I tend to pick up many hobbies very quickly and frequently. A few of these include: painting and drawing, singing and playing the guitar, photograghing the sky and nature, knitting and crotcheting, animanga and more! 
                        <p>
                            To see photos of these hobbies go to the gallery page. You can also click <a href="gallery.html">here</a> to access it.
                        </p> I also love learning new languages! Although I'm not a fluent, I am at least able to hold basic conversations in French, Japanese and Yoruba.I have little proficiency in Spanish, but hope to learn it again in the future.</p>

                    <p>Forensic Science isn't just CSI like you see on TV! There are a range of modules past fingerprinting and blood splatters. <br>
                        On my course I have learnt about DNA, history, art and jewelery, pharmacology, cybercrime/ digital forensics and more! <br>
                         I started my course in 2021, where I completed a science foundation year. Since 2022 I've been studying my main course and I'm now in year 3. Post this academic year, I'll be studying an intergrated masters. If you are interested click <a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/study/undergraduate2024/undergraduatecourses/forensicsciencewithintegratedmasters/#:~:text=Our%20MSci%20Forensic%20Science%20course,an%20effective%20researcher%20within%20an" target="_blank">here</a> to see what my course entails.
                        <p>I've been a peer academic buddy, and my goal for this year is to become a student ambassador and a peer mentor. My goal is to complete my course then perhaps go into a nursing or doctor apprenticeship as it is something I've always dreamed of doing. Otherwise id like to work in scientific, financial or digital forensics.</p>

                    <p> This summer I've taken time to learn some coding skills, using HTML and CSS with <a href="https://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/search/?s=couch+to+coder" target="_blank">Bright Network's Couch to Coder 2024</a> course. What I've learnt in the last few weeks has been used to create this website. I am also in the process of gaining a Level 1 & 2 certificate in British Sign Language (BSL), and a TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) qualification.</p>
